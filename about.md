## About Me

My name is **Joren Badendick**, and I’m a business student at Trinity Bible College. I enjoy leading, serving, and helping others in whatever ways I can, and I try to bring that into everything I’m a part of. 

I’ve always been someone who values relationships and wants to make a positive impact, whether that’s through school, work, or the people I meet along the way.

My biggest passions are **music** and **cars**, and both have shaped a lot of who I am. I love being part of worship ministry, and I enjoy anything that has to do with engines — big or small.

I’m still exploring what I want to do in life. **Entrepreneurship** has always piqued my interest, but I’m open to whatever opportunities God puts in front of me and wherever He leads me in the future.
