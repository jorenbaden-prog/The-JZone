When it comes to handling ownership, licensing, and attribution for the text and images on my site, I want to approach everything with honesty and integrity. Not all of the work I create will fall under the same category. Some projects or written pieces are personal to me and I would want them to remain my own property, meaning no one can use or reuse them unless I give clear permission. However, there are other kinds of work that I do not mind people using as long as they give proper credit. I think it is reasonable to allow certain posts or resources to be shared, especially if it helps someone, but it still matters that my work is acknowledged and not taken as someone else’s.

For images, most of what I use will either be photos I took myself or ones generated through AI. Because of that, I need to make sure I am clear about which images are fully my own and which ones come from AI tools. If I ever use an image that is not mine or not AI-generated, then I will make sure to follow the rules of attribution so the original creator is credited. It is important to me that I respect the work others have put in, just like I want my own work to be respected.

A Creative Commons license that could work well for my site is CC BY, which allows others to use my work as long as they give the proper credit. This license makes sense for some of my projects because it encourages sharing while still protecting my authorship.

A principle that guides the way I handle ownership and attribution is the idea of honoring others and being truthful in everything I do. Romans 13:7 talks about giving honor to whom honor is due, and I believe that applies to creative work as well. Using someone else’s words or images without crediting them does not reflect integrity, and I want my site to model honesty in the way I present my work and the work of others.
