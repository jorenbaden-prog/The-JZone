In the area of church administration and leadership, one likely bias or blind spot that AI can have is assuming that all churches function the same way. Every church has its own culture, traditions, volunteer dynamics, and spiritual practices, and AI does not always recognize those differences. I have seen this in my own experience when AI tried to describe how something worked in a church setting without fully understanding the context I was talking about. Instead of giving an answer that fit my church, it made a guess based on general patterns, which did not match how things actually operate in real life. This can become a problem when planning events, organizing teams, or explaining how volunteers function, because AI might unintentionally overlook things that are important to the people involved.

A simple safeguard I use is to double-check all the information AI gives me before applying it to anything practical. I never assume that AI fully understands my specific situation, especially in ministry. I make sure my own experience guides the content, and I compare what AI suggests with what I know from actually serving in church settings. This helps prevent misunderstandings and keeps the work accurate and meaningful.

A biblical principle that guides me in this area comes from Acts 10:34, which says that God shows no partiality. This reminds me that people, churches, and communities are unique, and they deserve to be understood fairly. Justice and impartiality mean taking the time to see people as individuals, not as general categories. If I want to lead well and honor the people I serve, I need to make sure the tools I use—like AI—do not cause me to overlook the real differences in how people and ministries work. By staying aware of these biases, I can use AI responsibly while still honoring God and the community I am serving.
