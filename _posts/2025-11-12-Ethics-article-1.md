excerpt: "How the Imago Dei Shapes My View of AI"

Being made in the image of God means that we are created as unique beings who reflect pieces of who He is through our body, mind, and spirit. Because we carry the Imago Dei, every part of us is meant to resemble the character of God and display aspects of His nature in the way we think, create, and live. When I think about the use of AI in regards to this, I view it as a tool that is to be used to expound upon our creativity. They are extensions of the creativity He has already placed within us. AI can be incredibly helpful in many areas of life, and its purpose is to assist us in building on the abilities God has given us.

Since God has given us a creative nature and a mind capable of incredible things, AI should never become a replacement for the critical thinking and creativity He designed us to use. It can help us brainstorm, organize ideas, or see things from new perspectives, but it should not take away our responsibility to engage our minds. In 1 Peter 4:10 it says, “Each of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve others, as faithful stewards of God’s grace.” This reminds us that stewardship and integrity matter when we use tools like AI. We honor God when we use our minds the way He intended, using them actively, thoughtfully, and with purpose.

A boundary I keep when using AI is not letting it replace my thinking or do the work for me. It is easy to fall into the habit of letting AI carry the weight of an assignment or task, but when we do that, we begin to lose the creativity we already have. I try to use AI only as a tool that helps me expand the ideas and organize the thoughts I already have. This keeps me connected to the abilities God has placed within me and reminds me that AI is not here to think for me, but to help me grow in the gifts He has given.

One practice that helps me use AI with humility is taking time to work through my own ideas before turning to it. I try to think, reflect, or write a few things down on my own first. This helps me stay honest in my efforts and keeps my creativity active. By putting in my own work before using AI, I stay aware that my abilities come from God, and the tool simply helps me shape those ideas more clearly. Using AI this way allows me to benefit from it without letting it replace the effort, thought, and creativity that God has already placed in my life.
