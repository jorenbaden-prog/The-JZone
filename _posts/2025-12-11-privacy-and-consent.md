In church administration, there are situations where private details can show up in prompts or outputs if I am not careful. Working in a church means dealing with information that people expect to be handled with respect, whether it is financial records, contact details, or personal conflicts among staff or volunteers. AI can be helpful when it comes to organizing thoughts, creating general plans, or helping me think through the structure of a project, but it should never be used in a way that risks exposing someone’s private situation. Anything shared in confidence or any personal struggles will never be included in an AI prompt. Even if I needed help thinking through a difficult or sensitive situation, I would not include names or anything that would reveal who the person is. Privacy matters too much to take that risk.

If I ever needed to use AI for something that involves another person’s information, I would only share it after they clearly agree to it. People deserve to know how their information is being used, especially in a ministry setting where trust is such an important part of the relationships we build. Consent is necessary because people come to church leaders with things that are personal, and they trust that what they share will be handled with care and wisdom. This means I need to be intentional with the tools I use so that I do not break that trust.

A principle that guides me in this is found in Philippians 2:4, which teaches us to look not only to our own interests but also to the interests of others. This verse reminds me that loving my neighbor means putting their well-being before my convenience. Protecting someone’s privacy, honoring their trust, and handling their information responsibly are all ways of showing that I value them. AI can be a helpful tool, but it should never come before the responsibility I have to care for people well and to honor God in how I use the resources He has given me.
