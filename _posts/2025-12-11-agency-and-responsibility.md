For this Ethics Check, the artifact I am talking about is the page I created for my church’s Christmas Eve service. It is a full service-event coordination write-up that includes the flow of the night, the teams involved, and how things typically run. The parts of the project that were my own were the main ideas, the details about how our church usually does this service, and the personal understanding I brought from being involved in these events. I didn’t create one single piece entirely on my own, but I provided the important information, context, and decisions that shaped the whole artifact. Everything started with what I already knew about our church and how the Christmas Eve service usually operates.

The parts that were AI-assisted mainly had to do with organizing and structuring the information. I had a lot of details in my head, and AI helped me arrange them in a way that made sense for someone reading the page. It helped put things into a clear order and format so the service plan was easy to follow on the site.

Even though AI helped with the structure, I stayed the author by reviewing everything first, checking for accuracy, and making sure nothing was included that didn’t reflect how our service actually works. I went through each section to confirm it matched the information I provided. I also made sure the writing still represented my personality and thoughts, because I want the way I communicate to feel real and not generic.

My plan for keeping my voice in future work is to continue using AI mainly for outlines and structure, not for writing the content itself. I will make sure to review and revise everything so it stays consistent with my writing style, and I will keep building that style over time so my work remains honest and personal.
