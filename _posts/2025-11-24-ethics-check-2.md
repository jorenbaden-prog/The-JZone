## Ethics Check #3

How I primarily use AI in my work is by having it read through the given directions for an assignment or project and help organize my thoughts in a way that is clear and understandable, often by creating outlines that I can follow so I can complete my tasks well. AI has been very helpful for me to complete things better and faster, but there are still some limitations I have to be aware of and guidelines I need to put in place to use it responsibly. The first risk is that AI can summarize information incorrectly or miss details that actually matter if I do not check beforehand. The second risk is that when I have it look over work I have already done and it makes corrections like grammar, spelling, or structure, it can often sound too generic and no longer match how I normally write, which means I have to go back and redo it again in my own voice.

Why this matters for a class is because the work needs to be accurate. If the information AI organizes is wrong, then the rest of the assignment will be wrong, and if it does not sound like me, then it becomes less helpful because I end up rewriting it anyway. If I posted something that did not reflect my voice or was inaccurate, it could also hurt my credibility for honesty.

How I reconcile these issues is, first, I always read and check the information I give AI so I know if it is accurate. Second, I have given AI examples of my writing style so it can match it more closely, which helps reduce how much I need to rewrite. Third, when using or citing sources, I always make sure they are credible and real. As mentioned before, I typically only use AI to outline or structure the assignment, not to write the final content, because then I can honestly say I completed the work myself. I also review everything before uploading it anywhere.

I do this because I believe in the biblical principles of truthfulness and being stewards of what God has given us, including technology and our minds. There are many verses in the Bible that tell us to be truthful and not lie to one another, because when we do, we are not honoring God or reflecting the image He created us in. The Bible also teaches us to be stewards of what God has given us. He has given us minds and abilities that made this kind of technology possible, and it is our responsibility to use it well so we do not misuse what He has provided. I do not want to be known as someone who misuses the tools given to them. AI can be a very helpful tool when used responsibly and honestly, and I will continue to use it in a way that honors God and emphasizes my own voice and effort.
