## The 'Culture Code'

1.  **Punctuality & Reliability**
    We honor God and our team by arriving on time, ready to serve. Being present for our pre-service meeting ensures we are unified and prepared for the day.
    > *"But everything should be done in a fitting and orderly way."* — **1 Corinthians 14:40**

2.  **Professional Appearance (Dress Code)**
    As the first face of the church, we dress in a way that is neat, modest, and distracting-free, remembering that we are ambassadors of Christ to every guest.
    > *"We are therefore Christ’s ambassadors, as though God were making his appeal through us."* — **2 Corinthians 5:20**

3.  **Attitude of Hospitality**
    We practice radical welcome, greeting everyone with warmth and sincerity. Our goal is to make every person feel seen, valued, and at home.
    > *"Share with the Lord’s people who are in need. Practice hospitality."* — **Romans 12:13**

4.  **Safety & Vigilance**
    While we are welcoming, we are also watchful. We care for the physical safety of the flock by staying alert to our surroundings and following safety protocols.
    > *"Keep watch over yourselves and all the flock of which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers."* — **Acts 20:28**

5.  **Prayer & Spiritual Preparation**
    We serve not just with smiles but with spirit. We commit to praying for our guests and our service, inviting the Holy Spirit to work through our interactions.
    > *"Devote yourselves to prayer, being watchful and thankful."* — **Colossians 4:2**

## Training Module: Conflict Resolution

### Scenario: Main Sanctuary at Capacity
**The Situation:** A visitor arrives late and is upset that they cannot enter the main sanctuary and must go to the Overflow Room.

**The Goal:** De-escalate the anger without compromising fire codes or safety regulations. Validate their disappointment while offering a hospitable solution.

| Don't Say ❌ | Do Say ✅ |
| :--- | :--- |
| "You can't go in there, it's full." | "I am so sorry, but the main sanctuary has actually reached full capacity right now." |
| "It's a fire hazard, so you have to move." | "To keep everyone safe, we have to keep the room within capacity laws. I appreciate you helping us with that." |
| "I don't make the rules, I just enforce them." | "I completely understand it's disappointing. I wish I could get you a seat in there, but my priority has to be safety." |
| "Just go to the overflow room." | "We have a comfortable spot open in the Overflow Room with a live feed. I can walk you over there right now." |

**Key De-escalation Principle:** **Validate first, then redirect.**
Instead of starting with "No," starts with "I understand." This lowers defenses and turns you from an "enforcer" into a "helper."
