**What it is:** A clean homepage with my voice: thoughtful, real, friendly, creative.

**Why it’s useful:** Gives visitors a quick sense of me and obvious next steps (Projects, Notes, About).

**What I learned:** How to publish with GitHub Pages and Jekyll, and how small steps make visible progress.
