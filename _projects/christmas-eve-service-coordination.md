## The Objective

The goal was to streamline the planning for an annual service while maintaining theological depth. By leveraging generative AI, we aimed to enhance the creative process for liturgy and improve operational efficiency.

## Part 1: Liturgical Design

Below is a sample of the AI-generated Responsive Reading / Theme used for the service.

> **Leader:** The people walking in darkness have seen a great light; on those living in the land of deep darkness, a light has dawned.
>
> **Congregation:** For to us a child is born, to us a son is given, and the government will be on his shoulders.
>
> **Leader:** But the angel said, "Do not be afraid. I bring you good news that will cause great joy for all the people."
>
> **Congregation:** Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you; he is the Messiah, the Lord.
>
> **Leader:** The zeal of the Lord Almighty has accomplished this; the ancient promise is kept this holy night.
>
> **Congregation:** Glory to God in the highest heaven, and on earth peace to those on whom his favor rests.
>
> **All:** Come, let us go to Bethlehem and worship the Newborn King!
