## SWOT Analysis

### Internal Factors (Strengths & Weaknesses)
*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Debt-Free Land:** Ownership of the property provides a significant financial head start and equity leverage.
    *   **Growing Congregation:** Consistent growth indicates a clear need for space and suggests potential for capital campaign support.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Funding/Finances:** Limited cash reserves or budget constraints may require significant external financing or aggressive fundraising.

### External Factors (Opportunities & Threats)
*   **Opportunities:**
    *   **Expanded Youth Ministry:** New facilities allow for dedicated spaces to attract and serve families and students.
    *   **Community Events:** A modern venue opens doors for hosting local events, increasing community visibility and outreach.
*   **Threats:**
    *   **Economic Factors:** Rising interest rates could increase the long-term cost of borrowing.
    *   **Construction Risks:** Potential delays and supply chain issues could push timelines and budgets over projections.
    *   **Donor Fatigue:** Risk of burdening the congregation if the capital campaign is not managed with spiritual sensitivity.
