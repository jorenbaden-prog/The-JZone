## The Scenario

A prominent local business owner, who is also a significant donor to the church, has requested to book the Main Sanctuary for a business launch party next Saturday. The critical issue is that the donor plans to cater alcohol for the event, which is strictly prohibited by the church's bylaws regarding alcohol on the premises. The challenge is to uphold the church's policy and decline this specific request without offending the donor or damaging a valued relationship.

## The 'Rough Draft' (The Human Reaction)

**Subject:** Venue Request

Hi [Name],

I saw your request for next Saturday. We can’t approve it because you want to serve alcohol. Our bylaws strictly say no alcohol is allowed on church property, so that’s a hard no. You can still rent the room if you want but the alcohol has to go.

Let me know what you want to do I have a lot of other requests coming in for that date.

Thanks,
Joren

## The AI Refinement (The Pastoral Response)

**Subject:** Launch Party Request & Next Steps

Dear [Name],

Thank you so much for reaching out, and congratulations on the upcoming launch! We are incredibly grateful for your continued generosity and partnership with our church—it truly means a lot to us to see your business grow.

Regarding your request to host the launch party in the Sanctuary next Saturday, we would love to host you, but I do need to address the catering plan. Our church bylaws maintain a strict alcohol-free policy for all events on the premises. This policy is in place to maintain integrity and ensure we are never a stumbling block to anyone in our community who may be struggling.

We would still be honored to host the event if we can move forward with a food-only catering plan. Alternatively, if alcohol is essential for the celebration, I completely understand if you need to look at other venues.

Let me know what works best for you! We value you highly and want to support you however we can.

Warmly,
Joren Badendick

## Analysis

*   **Preserving the Relationship:** Draft 2 separates the *person* from the *policy*. By starting with gratitude ("incredibly grateful for your partnership") and validating their success ("congratulations"), we affirm their value to the church before delivering the "no." This prevents the rejection of the request from feeling like a rejection of the relationship.
*   **Mission Alignment:** Instead of using the bylaws as a shield ("it's against the rules"), Draft 2 explains the *theological purpose* behind the policy ("integrity," "stumbling block"). This shifts the conversation from bureaucratic enforcement to shared missional values, inviting the donor to partner with us in upholding the church's witness.
