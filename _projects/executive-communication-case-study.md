## The Scenario

*[A text section explaining the situation: A long-time donor wants to rent the Fellowship Hall for a private event on a Saturday, but the Youth Ministry already has it booked.]*

---

## The 'Rough Draft' (The Human Reaction)

*[A section showing a blunt, stressed-out draft email that I wrote first.]*

---

## The AI Refinement (The Pastoral Response)

*[A section showing the final, polished email that declines the request but maintains the relationship.]*

---

## Analysis

*[A brief note on why the second version is better (e.g., 'Passive Voice vs. Active Voice', 'Empathy statements').]*
